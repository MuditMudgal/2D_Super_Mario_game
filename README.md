# 🎮 Super Mario 2D Game

This project is a 2D Super Mario-style game developed in **Python** using the **Pygame** library. The game features classic platformer mechanics such as player movement, jumping, enemies, obstacles, collectibles, and power-ups. It was built as part of a learning initiative to understand game development concepts, event handling, and modular programming in Python.

## 📖 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building interactive applications using Python. I learned about event handling, game loop design, modular coding, debugging, and performance optimization. This project also gave me a deeper understanding of how real-world games handle animations, sound, and user interaction.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Add more advanced levels with increasing difficulty
* Implement multiplayer functionality
* Improve enemy AI and behavior
* Create a leaderboard with online score tracking
